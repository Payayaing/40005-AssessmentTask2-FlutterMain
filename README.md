# FlutterMain (40005 Assessment Task 2)
**FlutterMain** is a convenient and intuitive iOS application which stores Pokémon builds, named after the Paradox Pokémon Flutter Mane. It allows users to store and customise Pokémon builds. Users can filter through a full Pokémon list to add to their personalised build list, and can edit Pokémon information from the Home screen.

## Supporting Platforms
* Designed for **iPhone 16 Pro**.
* Fully functional on **iPad** as well.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository using the link: `https://github.com/Payayaing/40005-AssessmentTask2-FlutterMain.git`
2. Open the project in XCode.
3. Select a simulator: recommended on **iPhone 16 Pro** but was also tested on **iPad**. 
4. Run the application.

## Dependencies
* Uses **Swift** and **SwiftUI** for implementation.
* Uses **iOS 17** and above.
* FlutterMain uses `pokeapi.co`, an modern open-source Pokémon API, to obtain Pokémon data.

## Usage
Upon running the application, the user is brought to the Home screen, which contains all personalised Pokémon builds. To add a Pokémon, they can click on the `Add Pokemon` button at the bottom of the screen, taking them to a full list of Pokémon (including Alternate forms). They can use the search bar at the top of the screen to search for the Pokémon they are looking for, and then press on it. This takes them back to the Home screen with the newly added Pokémon in their list. They can then press on the Pokémon, which takes them to a screen where they can customise the Pokémon nickname and its moveset.
